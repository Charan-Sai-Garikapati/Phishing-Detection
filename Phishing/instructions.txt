1. If any issues with Virtual Environment just delete "venv" folder else just skip to point 3.
2. Then Create new Virtual Environment with these code
    a. python -m venv venv
3. After Creating open your "CMD Terminal" for activating that venv. Dont use powershell !
    b. venv\Scripts\activate
4. You'll notice (venv) in your terminal which means you are in that venv.
    example: (venv) C:\USER\Projects\MAJOR PROJECT\sms-spam-classifier-main
5. Install the packages with this command (only once) if already installed before then no need
    a. pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run the code with this command
    a. python app.py
Note: Renaming Folder Names will create issues with virtual Environment. If you face anything like no module errors then run step 5
